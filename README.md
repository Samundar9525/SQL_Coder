# Project Documentation: SQL Generation Model Fine-tuning and Evaluation

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a language model for SQL generation from natural language questions, and how to evaluate its performance by executing the generated SQL queries on a PostgreSQL database and comparing the results to ground truth.  
**Prompt engineering** is used to format the input and extract the SQL from the model’s output. The training and evaluation data are managed in CSV files.

**Description:**  
- The process starts with a CSV file containing question/SQL pairs.
- Prompt engineering is used to format the input for the model and to extract the SQL from the model’s output.
- The fine-tuned LLM generates SQL queries from natural language questions.
- Generated SQL is executed on a PostgreSQL database.
- The results are compared with ground truth for evaluation and accuracy calculation.

---

## Steps Followed

### 1. Dataset Preparation

- Created a CSV file (`text2sql_dataset.csv`) containing pairs of natural language questions and their corresponding SQL queries.
- Example:
  ```
  question,sql_query
  Describe the purpose of from_date.,SELECT from_date FROM title;
  Which table contains dept_no?,SELECT dept_no FROM dept_emp;
  Where can I see the first_name?,SELECT first_name FROM employee;
  ```

### 2. Model Fine-tuning

- Used the `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0` model for fine-tuning due to hardware constraints.
- Fine-tuned the model using LoRA (parameter-efficient fine-tuning) with the `peft` library.
- Saved the adapter weights to `finetuned-sql-model`.

### 3. Merging LoRA Weights

- Merged the LoRA adapter weights with the base model to create a full model using:
  ```python
  from peft import PeftModel
  from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM

  base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0")
  peft_model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "./finetuned-sql-model")
  merged_model = peft_model.merge_and_unload()
  merged_model.save_pretrained("./merged-sql-model")
  ```
- Copied tokenizer files (`tokenizer.model`, `tokenizer_config.json`, etc.) from the base model cache to the `merged-sql-model` directory.

### 4. (Optional) Conversion to GGUF

- If needed for local inference with llama.cpp or ctransformers, converted the merged model to GGUF format using the `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` script from llama.cpp.

### 5. Test Data Preparation

- Created a test CSV file (`test.csv`) with the same format as the training data for evaluation.

### 6. Evaluation Script

- Wrote an evaluation script (`load_model_local.py`) that:
  - Loads the merged model and tokenizer from the local directory.
  - Connects to a local PostgreSQL database using `psycopg2`.
  - Loads the test data from `test.csv`.
  - For each test example:
    - Generates a SQL query from the question using the model.
    - Executes both the generated and ground truth SQL queries on the database.
    - Compares the results and prints the question, expected and predicted SQL, and their results.
    - Tracks the number of correct predictions.
  - Calculates and prints the overall accuracy.
  - Closes the database connection.

## Example Evaluation Script

```python
import pandas as pd
import psycopg2
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

# Load model and tokenizer
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("e:/QLGPT/SQL_Coder/merged-sql-model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("e:/QLGPT/SQL_Coder/merged-sql-model")

def generate_sql(question):
    prompt = f"### Instruction:\n{question}\n### Response:\n"
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model.generate(
        **inputs,
        max_new_tokens=64,
        do_sample=False,
        temperature=0.0,
        top_p=1.0,
        eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )
    answer = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    sql = answer.split("### Response:")[-1].strip()
    return sql

def execute_query(sql, conn):
    try:
        with conn.cursor() as cur:
            cur.execute(sql)
            result = cur.fetchall()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Query failed: {e}")
        return None

# Connect to Postgres
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    host="localhost",
    port=5432,
    database="employee",
    user="postgres",
    password="admin"
)

# Load test data
df = pd.read_csv("test.csv")

# Evaluate
correct = 0
total = len(df)
for idx, row in df.iterrows():
    pred_sql = generate_sql(row["question"])
    gt_sql = row["sql_query"].strip()
    pred_result = execute_query(pred_sql, conn)
    gt_result = execute_query(gt_sql, conn)
    print(f"Q: {row['question']}")
    print(f"Expected SQL: {gt_sql}")
    print(f"Predicted SQL: {pred_sql}")
    print(f"Expected Result: {gt_result}")
    print(f"Predicted Result: {pred_result}")
    print("-" * 40)
    if pred_result == gt_result:
        correct += 1

accuracy = correct / total * 100
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}% ({correct}/{total})")

conn.close()
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all required files (model, tokenizer, test data) are in the correct directories.
- Upgrade Python packages (`transformers`, `peft`, `huggingface_hub`, `torch`) as needed to resolve compatibility issues.
- Fix CSV header and formatting issues to avoid pandas `KeyError`.
- Handle missing tokenizer files by copying them from the base model cache.
